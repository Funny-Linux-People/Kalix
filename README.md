#
Pronounced kay-licks, kalyx is an ultra-generalized, easy to use, and expansive set of NixOS modules, centered around creating an OS like ecosystem that is interoperable between any nixos config. 

# History
kalyx was spawned from KyleOS, a system repository shared between friends. After growing to a considerable size it became apparent that while the system had many benefits, it failed to scale.

kalyx aims to solve this problem by providing a stable platform anyone can build on top of, while removing overhead for individual users.

# Why the flower?
A calyx is term used in botany to refer to the protective cup-like structure of a flower. Originally our spinoff name of calyx 'kalyx' was temporary. After prototyping the logo we found it was easy to morph the Nix logo into a flower like shape, so we decided to keep the name.
